# Highway Tweets

This started as a project to gather Twitter data related to a federal highway project (hence the name). However, it turned into a much more general-use tool.

The website tool allows a user to upload an HTML file and download a list of all tweets on that page, in JSON format.

Future plans are to expand functionality to other social networking sites, such as Facebook or LinkedIn.
